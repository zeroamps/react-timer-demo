# React Timer Demo

This is a react timer demo which you can see on [DEMO](https://zeroamps.github.io/react-timer-demo/).

I created this demo because I wanted to try [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) together with [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.netlify.app/). Other interesting libraries I use in the project are [classnames](https://www.npmjs.com/package/classnames), [dayjs](https://day.js.org/), [react-hook-form](https://www.react-hook-form.com/), [uuidv4](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uuidv4).
